# Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table
November 14, 2016

## Domain Background

Across Africa, cholera, typhoid, dysentery and other diseases kill thousands each year. To help the people of Tanzanian(in 2007), The Tanzanian government, with support from UN Development Programme(UNDP), responded to the water problems by install Drinking Water Taps and Decentralized the maintenance for quick repsonses.Today this water infrastructure is facing repair and maintenance issues causing a disconnection for drinking water needs.

This is also an intermediate-level practice competition by [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7).


## Problem Statement
Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, predicting which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all. Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. 



## Datasets and Inputs

Dataset is collected from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water which are available [here](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/data/). Taarifa is an open source platform for the crowd sourced reporting and triaging of infrastructure related issues and Tanzanian Ministry of Water is the central governing body to Tanzania.


### Improvement

The dataset(s) and/or input(s) to be used in the project are thoroughly described. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included. It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.
* awesome: you have a good overview of the dataset, also it was a good thing that you mentioned each feature.
* required: include the total number of instances
* suggestion: add the class label to the list of features and highlight it (maybe use bold).
* required: mention the class label distributions. This is often useful as you will use this to guide which metric will be used for evaluation (more on that on my comment on metrics).


Dataset Features:

* UniqCount: pands's values_count of that feature
* UniqVal: If Values_count is < 30, then we shall have that columns's respective values & counts

### Description of the Labels
The labels in this dataset are simple. There are three possible values:
* functional - the waterpoint is operational and there are no repairs needed
* functional needs repair - the waterpoint is operational, but needs repairs
* non functional - the waterpoint is not operational

|Col ID|Col Name|UniqCount|Col Values|UniqValCount|
|------|--------|---------|----------|------------|
|40|status_group|3|functional needs repair|4317|
||||functional|32259|
||||non functional|22824|




## Solution Statement
A smart understanding of which water points will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

### Improvement

Student clearly describes a solution to the problem. The solution is applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, the solution is quantifiable, measurable, and replicable.

* awesome: you described what you are hoping to achieve from solving the problem using the problem requirements.
* required: you also need in the solution statement to specify the overall strategy for solving the problem. In this case, you are going to use supervised learning, specifically multi-class classification.
* suggestion: the class label distribution does not belongs here, you shall move it to the dataset section. Also, when you mention "distribution of labels", one may expect that you present the amount of instances per class label, currently you just explain the 3 distinct possible labels.


## Benchmark Model
With a simplistic data transformation and with the help of Random Forest Classfier, we have created a benchmark submission of 0.7970 for which source code is [here](https://github.com/msampathkumar/datadriven_pumpit/blob/master/BenchMarkSeed_0.7970.ipynb)



## Evaluation Metrics

The metric used is the classification rate, which calculates the percentage of rows where the predicted class in the submission matches the actual class in the test set. The maximum is 1 and the minimum is 0. The goal is to maximize the classification rate.


<math display="block">
    <mi>Classification Rate</mi>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <msubsup><mi>(1/N)* âˆ‘</mi>
    			<mi>i=0</mi> <mi>N</mi>
    </msubsup>
    <msubsup><mi> I (Prediction == Actual)</mi>
    </msubsup>
</math>

### Improvement

Student proposes at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model presented. The evaluation metric(s) proposed are appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution.

required: you need to justify the use of accuracy based on the class labels distribution. Accuracy is meaningful if labels distributions are balanced. Consider the following example: (1) I want to predict whether a photo contains a cat or a dog and originally I have 50 dog photos and 50 cat photos; (2) If I had 95 dog photos and only 5 cat photos, my classifier would achieve 95% accuracy if it simply predicted every instance as dog photo. Notice that accuracy may deceive us if data is unbalanced as in (2).


## Project Design

As shown in below image, we are going to do a step by step development progress on here.
!$[Udacity Machine Learning Course Plan](https://github.com/msampathkumar/datadriven_pumpit/blob/master/UDACITY_ML_COURSE_GIST.png?raw=true)

With Random Forest Classifier, we were able to generate a benchmark of 0.7970. So, first we will start with going to deeper understanding of Random Forest worked and what features contributed it to generate this score in training.

(Basic Implementation Plan)

1. Questions on data
2. Feature Exploration
 * PCA Transformation Checking
 * Select K Best Checking
 * Exploration - outliers check
3. Algorithm Selection
 * Unsupervised Learning Exploration(Gaussian Process, Neural Nets)
 * Supervised Learning(GBT Trees, Nearest Neighbors, RF)
 * Parameter Tuning
4. Evaluation. Back to 1 with.

For next submission we are expecting a training benchmark of 88%.

Considered Model: Gradient Boosting Trees, Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest(RF).


!$[Classifers Comparision](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_classifier_comparison_001.png)

As we can see from above ananlysis, I find that `Nearest Neightbour` performs better when Random Forest is performing low. Also for different learning process from that of Random Forest. GBT Tree, sometime have seems performed better than Random Forest. 

We will be using Gaussian Process, Neural Nets for unsupervised Learning exploration. No specific reason but taken, two models different kinds of models for exploration.
